# Div-Sort
Div sort is a new hybrid sorting algorithm developed by me.
It perform the most suitable sorting operations on the data based on the state of data by first judging it in O(n) time for faster sorting time with reduced  time complexity. 
It combines elements from Count sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, Bubble sort and have some additional logic of it's own. I have implemented the algorithm in Python 3.
Time complexity:
best : o(n)   average : âŠ˜(nlogn)   worst : O(nlogn)
